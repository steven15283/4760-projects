  6 Bhatia said that we can just get the time in palin using time(), instead of using a shared memory clock. I just printf all the comments on entering, exiting, and if a process has entered critical state. With the input text file,     I have it set so that it reads line
  7 by line so if the file has this: aaaaaaaaa, bbbbbbbb, dddddddd, cccccccc it will just get all that as one string. it wont seperate them.
